# Something Awesome

Ideas based on cool things at work(s):

- XLSX templater
- In-browser ZIP extraction / resume-able upload
- Postgres as queue
- Rust file-based routing
- Full end-to-end testing

Unfinished side-projects:

- ulti.td
- nosh
- wine
- tracker

Past ideas which I could start (maybe a bad idea):

- Savings tracker (with scraping)
- Holiday waypoints
- Blossom
- Automated MacOS setup
